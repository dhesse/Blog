% Armed Conflicts in Africa, Illustrated in R

Sometimes (most of the time), a data scientist's life may seem like
fun and games. But sometimes, we have to deal with the graver
topics in life. Like *armed conflicts*.

One of the most interesting public data sources around was created by
the *Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project*
([ACLED][acled]). They have very accurate and ever growing data of at
the time of this writing some 100k individual events around armed
conflicts primarily in Africa, with the exception of a few in
countries in South and Southeast Asia. Their purpose is to

- Recording acts of violence between rebels, militias and
  governments.
- Record acts of violence against civilians.
- Map out strongholds of armed groups.
- Collect data on riots and protest.

You see, it's grave business. But at the same time extremely important
work. I'd encourage you to [check their website][acled]. The data range
back to *1997* and contain for each event

- The country.
- The date.
- The two main parties involved.
- The geographical location.
- The number of casulaties.
- Notes about the conflict.

So what could one do with this kind of data? The first step is as
usual to get an overview. We do this again in [R][R]. For displaying
geo-spatial data, we will the excellent [ggmap][ggmap] package.

We would like to plot *all* the incidents recorded on a map,
distinguishing the time of the events and number of fatalities. We
will represent each event by a dot, with the size representing the
number of fatalities and the color indicating the year. All this can
be done with a few lines of R code. You can download the script [from
github][blog-code-github].

<insert
kind="source"
file="EDA.R"
lines="1-23">

You see that we had to filter on the number of fatalities in line 17,
which effectively just removes one sad event from the
[First Congo War][congo-war] where a mass grave was found. I've warned
you that we're dealing with a grave topic. But now you know how to
make graphs like the one below and inform people what's going wrong in
the world and maybe do your part to help improving matters.

I think ACLED did an amazing job to provide us with a fascinating data
set. Stay tuned for a deeper dive into it.
