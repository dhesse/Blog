% Conflicts in Africa, Illustrated in R

Sometimes (most of the time), a data scientist's life may seem like
fun and games. But sometimes, we have to deal with the graver
topics in life. Like armed conflicts.

One of the cooler public data sources around is the Armed Conflict
Location & Event Data Project ([ACLED][acled]). They have very
accurate data of by the time of this writing some 100k individual
events around armed conflicts primarily in Africa, with the exception
of a few in countries in South and Southeast Asia. Their purpose is to

- Recording acts of violence between rebels, militias and
  governments.
- Recording acts of violence against civilians.
- Mapping out strongholds of armed groups.
- Collecting data on riots and protest.

You see, it's grave business. But at the same time extremely important
work. I'd encourage you to [check their website][acled]. The data ranges
back to 1997 and contain for each event

- The country.
- The date.
- The two main parties involved.
- The geographical location.
- The number of casulaties.
- Notes about the conflict.

So what could one do with this kind of data? The first step is as
usual to get an overview over our data set. We do this again in [R][R]
For displaying geo-spatial data, we will use the excellent
[ggmap][ggmap] package.

We would like to plot all the incidents recorded on a map, with means
to distinguish the times and number of fatalities. We will represent
each event with a dot, with the size representing the number of
fatalities and the color the year. All this can be done with a few
lines of R code. You can download the script from github.
