% Can't Buy Me Love: Hacking Dating Site Profiles

### DISCLAIMER

You don't take things you read here seriously, do you? You really
shouldn't. At least not by and large. I hope you'll get some neat
ideas and will be inspired to try out a technology you haven't used
before every now and then, but it would be foolish to draw any
conclusions from things I find in the datasets presented here. I mean,
I'm a data scientist, and most of the methods I use in this blog are
pretty sound, but don't make life decisions based on things you read
here. Consider yourself warned.

# The Wonderful World of Online Dating

The other day, I came across a [very neat data set][okcdata]
containing approximately 60k anonymized profiles taken from the dating
site [OkCupid]. Users have entered things like salary, habits (e.g.
drinking, drug use, etc.), education, age, and a few more. One usually
has to be quite careful with self-reported numbers
([social desirability bias][scb] comes to mind), and taking a sample
from a dating website as representative for the population at large
certainly will introduce one hell of a [selection bias]. And yes, you
should be very aware of which kind of biases your data will likely
exhibit. It can be hard to quantify biases (c.f. the polls and the US'
president-elect) but it's usually just a matter of common sense to
identify the worst ones you will likely have to deal with.

But then sometimes you can ask a question that just navigates around
the biases. Like this one: Assuming that a user being inactive for
more than 14 days indicates that one found true love, what features of
the profile make a person attractive? Age? Income? Education? Luckily,
we can find out.

Let's first have a look at those 14 days. The histogram of inactive
days looks like this:

Even though 14 days inactivity meaning you found love is arbitrary and
possibly overly optimistic, but looking at the graph it kind of makes
sense (and I'm an optimist).

So what makes people being inactive? Let's fit a
[logistic regression][glm] to the data. We shouldn't have any
illusions about it's predictive power, but at least we will be able to
answer an important question: What makes people fall in love? Brains
or money? Hence the call for my model looks like this (be warned,
you'll need to do some data cleansing before this will work):

~~~
model <- glm(active~age+income+education+sex,
             data = data,
             family=binomial(link='logit'))
~~~

Plotting the relevant variables gives us the following graph.

So the romantics can rest assured, it's what's in your brain that
counts, not how deep your pockets are.
