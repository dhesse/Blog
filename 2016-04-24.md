% Data Science For a Cause, Grouping Conflicts in Africa

[Last time][last] we started looking at a fascinating data set from
the *Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project* ([ACLED][acled]),
that lists incidents in armed conflicts all over Africa and some
countries in South and Southeast Asia, since 1997 and in great
detail. Make sure you have a look, if you like you can download my
code [from github][blog-code-github] in order to get you started.

We will keep on using [R][R], with the excellent [dplyr][dplyr]
package for data wrangling and [ggmap][ggmap] for plotting maps. What
we want to do today is finding groups of incidents that are
geographically close together, as well as occurring at a similar
time. This is a quite straight-forward
[unsupervised learning][unsupervised] problem in the class of
[clustering][clustering]. We will in particular use the
[hierarchical clustering][hclust-wiki] method, implemented in R in the
[hclust][hclust] function.

Before we can apply it though, we should *normalize* our data. This is
always wise if you apply methods like clustering where you compare
variables measured in different ways. We can convert our date column
into a numerical value that is needed as input for the method in
charge of calculating the distance matrix (which in turn is input to
the clustering method) simply by calling

<insert kind='source' file='clustering.R' lines='11-11'>

Now if we didn't use `scale` scale function to remove the mean and
bring the standard deviation to one, we would run into trouble when we
start comparing this column with latitude and longitude, which are
measured in completely different units. Our code looks like this:

<insert kind='source' file='clustering.R' lines='1-30'>

Now let's look at the output.

It seems like the clustering algorithm does do a sensible job. Stay
tuned for more in-depth analysis on the clusters.
