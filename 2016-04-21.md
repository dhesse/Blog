% A Data Scientist's Toolbox, Part 3: Mock Your Data!

After we've discussed the [importance of testing][last], you probably
have the feeling that it's a good idea, on general grounds, but *your*
code is *really* tough to test. You have all these *dependencies* and
your app writes to a database, and you have to load your data. So,
yea. Not doable. Or so you think.

Well, there are a few tricks you can apply. As for reading data, it's
rather easy, actually. You can use the [StringIO][stringio] package to
*mock* a file object and use that as an argument to the function that
reads your data. Let's assume you have a `.csv` file that's actually
not *C*SV, but rather separated with the vertical bar "|" (or
[Sheffer Stroke][sstroke]). You want to make sure this is taken into
account across the project, so you want to test for it (good
idea!). It's as easy as this:

<insert
kind="source"
file="mockdata.py"
lines="1-13">

That thing we just did? The one where we used a file object as input
rather than a string and then open the file object inside the
function?  That's a *very* good idea when writing code. It's called
*flexibility*. You don't really care what object you get as an
argument. It just needs to have a `read` function. You could even get
input from a REST API or some form of database in the future. This is
one of the neat things about testing. Making you code testable usually
makes it more modular and flexible.

Speaking of databases. What if we want to mock a database instead of a
file? We have to work a bit harder. Sometimes one can just use a local
instance of the database. But often it's better to make a mock object,
one that simulates the database (or whatever you need to mock) with
limited functionality. This way your tests can run on any machine,
even if it has no access to a database of the right kind.

One instructive way to go is to hack your own. Let's assume you want
to store configuration in a [MongoDB][mongodb] instance and need to
make sure that the `update` function of the right database in the
right collection is called. You can do this e.g. thusly.

<insert
kind="source"
file="mockdemo"
lines="1-39">

You see that we have to jump through a bunch of hoops to get the
member lookup right, but well. That's how MongoDB behaves. In a
real-world application you would probably want something more
industry-grade. You can check the excellent selection of
[mock frameworks on the python homepage][mock]. A mock framework makes
the creation of mock objects easy and often gives them some basic
functionality, like watching and counting function calls. Happy
mocking!
