% IoT 101 - Part 2: Kafka, Flask, and Server-Sent Events

In the [last episode][last], we wrote some simple code to produce
messages in [Apache Kafka][kafka] via a [RESTful API][rest],
implemented using the amazing [Flask][flask] framework. If you have
followed the [post][last] and written some code yourself, you might
now want to put it into action. We assume you have Kafka fired up and
written and started up a simple Flask app as described
[before][last].

## Testing Client

To give our setup a test drive, let's write a simple Kafka consumer in
[Python][python] using the [pykafka][pykafka] package. For the sake of
simplicity, let's just consume all messages in the topic named "test",
like so:

<insert kind="source" file="client.py" />

Running this script should print out all messages that get written to
our test topic until the script is terminated. You can also use the
console consumer (and producer) included with Kafka, but let's in the
spirit of DIY not do that.

## Producing Messages

To produce messages, we could write another Python script using
[pykafka][pykafka], but this is not what we want. We wrote our Flask
app such that we can produce messages using [http][http]. And being
true hipsters, we will do it *old school*, using the console and
[cURL][curl].

<insert kind="source" file="produce.sh" />

This should trigger the output `Message: {{"Hello": "World"}}` from
your client script.

## Consuming With Flask

Now let's do something more exciting than writing messages to the
*console*. Let's spit them out as
[HTML5 server-sent events][sse]. This way we'll be able to consume
them later in a webpage using [javascript][js] and ultimately create a
live dashboard. This could be used to monitor temperatures of a
machine or something like that. For this we need to add one more route
to our Flask app.

<insert kind="source" file="routes.py" lines="21-27" />

I'll give you some time now to implement this and check in with you
next time when we'll write some javascript to consume our messages.
