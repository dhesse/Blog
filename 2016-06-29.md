% IoT 101 - Part 3: Dynamic Web Pages with AngularJS, Kafka and Flask

In the [last][iot1] [two episodes][iot2], we talked about creating a
simple IoT-like service, using [Kafka][kafka] to produce and consume
messages in real-time and [Flask][flask] to create a REST API to allow
us producing messages via HTTP and consume them using server-sent
events ([SSE][sse]). [In the end][iot2], we managed to get our
messages pushed to clients using SSE, and now it is time to have a
closer look at the client code.

# SSE and Javascript

Assume you have a webpage that should react on events sent by your web
server. The first thing you'll have to do is add an *event
listener*. This is really easy and takes only a few lines of
Javascript code.

<insert kind="source" file="listener.js">

Adding this into an HTML document should be enough to see messages you
produce with CURL, like we described [last time][iot2], logged to your
browser's console. But this is not very exciting. You know what would
be exciting? If your webpage got *updated* automatically with new
messages. Enter Angular.

# AngularJS

[AngularJS][ng] is a complete, Javascript based implementation of the
[model-view-controller][mvc] pattern, which is nerd-speak for saying
that it helps you write dynamic HTML pages with minimal effort and
maximal effect, separating completely the presentation of the user
interface from the program logic. Read the Wikipedia article linked
above if you're interested in why this is such a good idea.

Let's dive right in. Assume you have a list of things that you want to
display on a web page, but maybe you want to update that list by, say,
SSE in the future and hence don't want to hard-code it in HTML. How
would you go about it? Well, you write a Javascript file thusly.

<insert kind="source" file="app1.js">

This tells Angular that we have an app called "myApp", and define the
the underlying controller. In the controller's scope, we have a single
variable, our list of messages. In our web page, we now have to load
Angular, but instead of downloading it, we use an easier path prepared
for us by the kind people at [Google][glibs] who host a number of
popular libraries for us. Our web page looks like this.

<insert kind="source" file="index.html">

If everything went right, you should now see a list like this in your
browser.

- One
- Two
- Three

# Putting Everything Together

Let's put all the moving parts together. Our modified app will add the
messages sent by the server to the list and thus dynamically update
the web page with server-sent events.

<insert kind="source" file="app2.js">

Keep in mind that by default, the base URL of your SSE and your
webpage must be identical, so you'll have to host your static HTML and
Javascript files through Flask or your web server should you use one
(which is a good idea, at least in a production environment).

I hope you've enjoyed this episode and stay tuned for the next data
adventure.
