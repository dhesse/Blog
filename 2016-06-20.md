% IoT 101 - Flask and Kafka

These days the internet of things (IoT) is virtually
[everywhere][iot1] [you][iot2] [look][iot3]. And as it is often with
things approaching the peak of the [hype cycle][hypecycle], many seem
to struggle to explain what the heck IoT really *is*. A common
denominator seems to be that in the future our fridge will talk to our
phone to remind us to buy milk once we are in the supermarket and your
house will turn the heat up/AC on when you're about to get home. Only
that the future is *now* and that some of those technologies are
[here][fridge] [today][nest] (let's leave out the
[discussion][econiot] that companies really struggle to actually sell
them to customers).

Still, it's high time we start exploring all the wonderful real-time
streaming technologies out there and how to harness them in order to
build cool stuff (like RESTful APIs, which are [awesome][rest]).

## Flask

The amazing [flask][flask] framework allows you to build web
applications in a matter of minutes. I highly recommend you check it
out. The mandatory "Hello, World" example is literally under ten lines
of code.

<insert kind="source" file="flask.py">

## Kafka

[Apache Kafka][kafka] is a distributed publish-subscribe messaging
system. Originally developed by [Linkedin][linkedin], it is commonly
used for high-throughput messaging applications such as collecting
user clicks on webpages, aggregating logs, stream processing, and the
like. Since the IoT premise is that virtually every device will be
linked up to the internet and talking to whatever services are
relevant, Kafka seems like a solid choice. It's also really easy to
set up and use. Once you've downloaded it, all you need to do
(provided you have a JVM installed) is issue these commands.

## Putting it together

Let's start simple. Assume you want to provide an API to list all
topics, it would be as easy as that (thanks to [pykafka][pykafka]):

<insert kind="source" file="routes.py" lines="1-9" />

Don't forget to import `jsonify` from `flask`.

Let's do something more exciting. Like writing to a topic. It's also
really easy, just a few lines of code including parsing.

<insert kind="source" file="routes.py" lines="11-19" />

I hope you enjoyed this post and stay tuned for the next episode in
which we will consume some messages. As usual, if you have any
questions or want me to talk about a certain topic that interests you,
shoot me a message!
