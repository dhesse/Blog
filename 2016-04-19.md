% A Data Scientist's Toolbox, part 2: Testing your code.

[In the last post][tool1], I talked about the usefulness of
[REPLs][repl] which is indeed hard to overstate. Exploratory data
analysis would be a lot of hassle without the read-evaluate-print
loop. We had a closer look at [Jupyter][jupyter] in particular. Our
first attempts at analyzing the data from the post
[on food and inflation][fi] can be found [on github][toolrepo].

So REPLs are great tools. Really great. I mean, for exploratory
analysis. Most of it, that is. Let me explain. REPLs have one major
drawback. Code in e.g. a Jupyter notebook is *very hard to test* and
the thing about code that's hard to test is that it usually doesn't
get tested at all. It's just in our nature to be lazy, so if something
is a hassle, you usually just don't do it, unless it's strictly
required. And clearly your code will execute (after you fiddle with it
until it *seems* to work alright, at which point you save and slowly
walk away from your computer) just fine without tests. But do you
*know* it's doing the right thing?

Let's take a minute to talk about test driven development (or
[TDD][tdd]). Some argue that you don't need unit testing, for various
reasons. Like it slows you down coding. Gives you a false sense of
security. All the arguments I've heard against TDD have one thing in
common. They're *wrong*. I tend to agree [with Uncle Bob][tdddebate]
on the matter.

Now we're no software developers but data scientists. I don't demand
that you unit test every last line of your analysis. But I do believe
it is a good idea to break out what you can from a notebook and write
some tests for it. Why? *Code reuse*. If you have that neat function
in a separate file with some tests going on, you'll be more likely to
re-use it. Why? Because you trust it. Because it's tested. Let's have
a look.

Last time, we had a neat little function that would normalize a
series.
