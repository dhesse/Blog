% Anomaly Detection in R: Euro 2016 Edition

Long time no hear. I've been terribly busy. But we'll talk about
something exciting, I promise. I've been working a fair bit with
anomaly detection in the last months, and browsing through
[Andrew Ng's excellent machine learning course][ngml], I was curious
to try out his anomaly detection algorithm that reads a bit like this:

1) Select a number of features $X_1, \ldots, X_n$.
2) If any variable $X_i$ does *not* look Gaussian enough (for some definition of "Gaussian enough"), find a suitable transformation $x'_i = f_i(x)$ with e.g. $f_i(x) = x^{0.5}$ and use the $X'_i$ instead of $X_i$ where needed.
3) Calculate the mean and standard deviation $\mu_i$ and $\sigma_i$.
